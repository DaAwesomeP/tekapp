                        PREAMBLE
                        The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
                        development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
                        efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
                        open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
                        with others.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
                        redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
                        fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
                        redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
                        names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
                        however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
                        requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
                        to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
                        <p>

                        DEFINITIONS
                        "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
                        Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
                        include source files, build scripts and documentation.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
                        copyright statement(s).
                        <p>

                        "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
                        distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
                        or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
                        Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
                        new environment.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
                        writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

                        </p>
                        PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
                        Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
                        a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
                        redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
                        Software, subject to the following conditions:
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
                        in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
                        redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
                        contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
                        included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
                        in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
                        binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
                        Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
                        Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
                        presented to the users.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
                        Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
                        Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
                        Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
                        permission.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
                        must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
                        distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
                        remain under this license does not apply to any document created
                        using the Font Software.
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        TERMINATION
                        This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
                        not met.
                        <p>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may use the code at no charge in commercial or non-commercial apps, web sites, games, components, and other software as long as end users are not charged a fee of any kind to use your product or gain access to any part of it. If your client pays you a one-time fee to create the site/product, that's perfectly fine and qualifies under the "no charge" license. If end users are charged a usage/access/license fee, please sign up for a "Business Green" Club GreenSock membership which comes with a comprehensive commercial license. See http://greensock.com/club/ for details.
                            Use at your own risk. No warranties are offered.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and GreenSock, Inc. ("GREENSOCK") for the proprietary GreenSock code known as TweenLite, TweenMax, TweenNano, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, and other copyrighted code that is available for download at http://www.greensock.com (this code and documentation, as well as any updates which may at GREENSOCK's sole discretion be provided to you from time to time, are referred to in this Agreement as "PROGRAM"). By downloading, copying, or otherwise using the PROGRAM, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not download or use the PROGRAM.
                        I. LICENSE
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, GREENSOCK hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable right to use the PROGRAM in apps, web sites, games, components and other software applications ("Developed Works") for which the end user is NOT charged any fees. If you would like to use the code in a commercially licensed Developed Work for which end users are charged a fee (either for usage or access), simply sign up for the appropriate "Business Green" Club GreenSock membership at http://www.greensock.com/club/.
                        II. LIMITATION OF LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A. You agree that you will not sell, rent, or license the PROGRAM's source code or any derivative works thereof to any third party without the prior written consent of GREENSOCK. Distribution of the PROGRAM as part of your Developed Work is acceptable so long as it is used exclusively as a part of your Developed Work. You agree not to modify or delete GREENSOCK'S existing copyright notices located in the source code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        B. You may use, duplicate, and distribute the compiled object code as embedded in Developed Works created by you, either for your own use or for distribution to a third party so long as end users of the Developed Work are not charged a fee for usage of or access to any portion of the Developed Work. Please see http://www.greensock.com/licensing/ for descriptions of Developed Works that qualify for the "No Charge" license.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        C. You may make modifications to the source code exclusively for your own use in order to perform bug fixes or other minor edits required to operate the PROGRAM as originally intended.
                        III. CONSIDERATION
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A. The license rights granted to you under this Agreement are at no charge, but only in the following circumstances: If on your own behalf or on behalf of a third party you incorporate the PROGRAM into a web site, app, game, program or any component thereof (collectively, "Developed Work"), which in the case of a web site, must be accessible to internet users without payment of a fee of any kind, and in the case of a software application, game, program or component, neither you nor anyone to whom you distribute the Developed Work charges a user a fee of any kind to use such Developed Work or application, game, program or component into which such Developed Work is embedded. The foregoing shall apply regardless of whether you are paid to create such Developed Work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        B. In the event your intended use of the PROGRAM does not meet the criteria for the "no charge" license rights set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, then you are not licensed to use the PROGRAM under this Agreement and must license the PROGRAM under GREENSOCK'S separate fee-based Software License Agreement which is granted to "Business Green" Club GreenSock members (see http://greensock.com/club/ for details).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        C. You may make modifications to the source code exclusively for your own use in order to perform bug fixes or other minor edits required to operate the PROGRAM as originally intended.
                        IV. TITLE AND OWNERSHIP
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The PROGRAM is licensed, not sold, and is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. You acknowledge that no title to the intellectual property in the PROGRAM is transferred to you. You further acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the PROGRAM, including all intellectual property rights therein, will remain the exclusive property of GREENSOCK and you will not acquire any rights to the PROGRAM except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. You agree that any copies of the PROGRAM you make will contain the same proprietary notices which appear on and in the PROGRAM. You agree that GREENSOCK may identify you as a licensee unless you make a written request otherwise. GREENSOCK hereby grants to you the right to disclose that your product, game, software application, component, or other Developed Work makes use of GREENSOCK code (for example, "Powered by TweenLite").
                        V. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. GREENSOCK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. GREENSOCK shall not be liable for special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages with respect to any claim on account of or arising from this Agreement or use of the PROGRAM, even if GREENSOCK has been or is hereafter advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states do not allow certain exclusions or limitations on implied warranties or of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above exclusions may not apply to you. In no event, however, will GREENSOCK be liable to you, under any theory of recovery, in an amount in excess of $250. Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, you agree to indemnify GREENSOCK, its assignees, and licensees, and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses, including legal fees arising out of or resulting from any negligent act or omission by you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        B. GREENSOCK may, at its sole discretion, provide support services related to the PROGRAM, but has no obligation to do so.
                        VI. TERMINATION
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If you at any time fail to abide by the terms of this Agreement, GREENSOCK shall have the right to immediately terminate the license granted herein and pursue any other legal or equitable remedies available.
                        VII. MISCELLANEOUS
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois. In the event of any dispute between you and GREENSOCK with respect to this Agreement, we both agree that if we cannot resolve the dispute in good faith discussion, either of us may submit the dispute for resolution to arbitration with the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator using the AAA Rules for Commercial Arbitration. The arbitrator's decision is final and can be enforced in any court with jurisdiction over such matters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        B. This agreement represents the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between GREENSOCK and you and supersedes all prior agreements, proposals, representations and other communications, verbal or written, between them with respect to use of the program. This agreement may be modified only with the mutual written approval of authorized representatives of the parties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        C. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any different, conflicting, or additional terms or conditions which may appear in any purchase order or other document submitted by you. You agree that such additional or inconsistent terms are deemed rejected by GREENSOCK.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        D. GREENSOCK and you agree that any xerographically or electronically reproduced copy of this Agreement shall have the same legal force and effect as any copy bearing original signatures of the parties.

                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
                        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
                        by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
                        appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only

                        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
                        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
                        this License.

                        in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
                        NOTICE file.</p>

                        applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and

                        of permissions under this License.</p>
                        <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong>. In no event and

                        otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
                        grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
                        of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
                        but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
                        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
                        even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                        damages.</p>

                        and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,

                        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
                        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
